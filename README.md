# My First Microservices App

Hello, this is my first ever microservices app, it's a simple app using Docker and Kubernetes, I had built this app to understand the basics of microservices and currently, I'm building a much larger one while taking the amazing course "Microservices with Node JS and React" by Stephen Grider on udemy.
